# Assignment-1-.NET

#### RPGHeroes

This repo contains the code for the first assignment of the backend part of the .NET course in Noroff Accelarate. This console application lets you create heroes that have a set of values. These heroes can then equip items to boost some of their values. The project was created with C#.

#### Installing and running

There is not much to run in this console application. The application is "run" through the unit tests as this was the requirement of the assignment.

You can clone the repo and run the tests yourself in Visual Studio by going to: 

Test > Run All Tests
